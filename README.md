# BinanceSpotPracticeTool
A terrible app for trading practice with virtual account


# Instructions
Set the starting account balance in akaunt.txt then run testApp.py
This app was meant to be used while watching prices on binance.com

Pick a ticker in the top left corner of your app
then place either MARKET order which execute imidiately
or LIMIT order that will wait for the coin to reach desired price to execute

I'm bad at this. Don't judge me
